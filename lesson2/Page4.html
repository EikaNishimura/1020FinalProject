    <article><h2>My dog, Khepri</h2>

        <p>
            I adopted Khepri in May of 2019 when he was only four months old. He is a German shepherd, lab, and
            Australian cattle dog mix. He only weighs around 35 lbs, but has the confidence of a full grown German
            shepherd. He isn't friendly towards strangers at first, but once he is comfortable, he is the sweetest dog
            you'll ever meet. He is very selective about his fellow dog friends and who he lets into the pack.

    <article><h2>Here are 10 German Shepherd facts!</h2>
        <p>

            <ol>
            <li><h3>German Shepherds will explore everything with their noses</h3></li>
            You’ll find evidence of their very thorough sniffing everywhere – walls, doors, windows, and more. All dogs
            have a better sense of smell than humans – 10,000 to 100,000 times better in fact thanks to having millions
            more scent receptors. But compared to other breeds, the GSD ranks near the top in scenting ability. It’s no
            wonder they make such great police and detection dogs. Among many other jobs, GSDs are known for their bomb
            and drug sniffing work, tracking, and search and rescue.
            <li><h3>GSDs are incredibly smart</h3></li>
            If you’re a German Shepherd owner, you have a strong suspicion your dog might actually be smarter than you
            are. After all, what can’t your dog do? These dogs are known for their intelligence and many can learn a new
            behavior in only a few repetitions. In addition, they have a legendary desire to cooperate and work with us,
            a trait many see as a wish to please their humans. No wonder this breed excels at so many activities and is
            a top Obedience competitor. Because German Shepherds are one of the brightest breeds, be sure to be consistent,
            use positive reinforcement-based methods, provide plenty of mentally stimulating toys, and play brain-challenging
            games.
            <li><h3>German Shepherd Dogs are protective of their loved ones</h3></li>
            They are known for being fearless and self-confident. GSDs will assertively stand their ground and are suited
            to be either watchdog or guardian, whichever the situation demands. They can be aloof with strangers yet
            are not hostile. This natural protective instinct is reassuring to the German Shepherd owner. But it also
            comes with a certain responsibility. You should be committed to spending time socializing and training your
            dog to ensure your companion feels comfortable around strangers and other dogs. If you do, you will benefit
            from all this dog has to offer.
            <li><h3>GSDs provide constant companionship</h3></li>
            In truth, German Shepherd owners are never lonely because their loyal canines are always by their side.
            Although GSDs are sometimes slow to warm to strangers, they are gentle and loving with their families.
            Their affectionate and dedicated personalities are a bonus of the breed, and they can be particularly fond
            of children. This means your GSD wants to spend time with you rather than being left alone all day, every day.
            Allowing your German Shepherd to be with you as much as possible will bring out the best in your dog.
            <li><h3>German Shepherds are known as a mouthy breed</h3></li>
            They tend to use their mouths as an appendage thanks to their herding heritage. It’s even right there in
            their name, ShepHERD. This mouthing behavior is natural, so expect your GSD to mouth you and chew anything
            that will fit inside their mouth. However, that doesn’t mean you should allow it. What might be cute in your
            small puppy will get more powerful as your dog grows up. Training your dog not to bite your hand or the chew
            on the furniture is essential with this breed. Teach your German Shepherd to channel those instincts safely
            and appropriately.
            <li><h3>German Shepherds shed</h3></li>
            All GSD owners know that dog hair is a way of life. You find it on the furniture, the floor, and on every
            outfit you wear. According to the German Shepherd Dog breed standard, the ideal GSD has a double coat of
            medium length with an outer coat that’s as dense as possible. That makes for a lot of fur! Not only do these
            dogs shed continuously, they also blow their coat (lose all their undercoat) twice a year, in the spring and
            fall. To help with shedding, brush your dog regularly. You’ll still have fur balls flying about, but just
            consider them a GSD-owner’s badge of honor.
            <li><h3>German Shepherd Dogs are known for their versatility</h3></li>
            If you need any job done, just ask your dog. GSD owners understand their dogs were developed as working dogs.
            In fact, the ideal German Shepherd has a body and gait suited to the hard work that is considered its primary
            purpose. This means your dog can excel at almost anything. From dog sports like rally, agility, scent work,
            therapy work, to service dog work, German Shepherds can do it all. The only thing holding your dog back is
            the time and energy you can commit to training. It’s no wonder people always think your dog is a service or
            police dog.
            <li><h3>GSDs are super active</h3></li>
            Therefore, so are you. Thinking of lounging on the couch? No way! German Shepherd owners know that won’t
            happen until you’ve walked your dog, gone to the park, or provided some sort of exercise. This breed only
            thrives with enough regular exercise to burn off all that excess energy. If you don’t give your GSD daily
            workouts, watch out. Your dog will get that energy out somehow, and most likely in ways you don’t want. To
            be sure your German Shepherd is happy and a pleasure to live with, you will definitely get all the exercise
            you need too.
            <li><h3>German Shepherds are members of the Herding Group</h3></li>
            So, if you own this breed, you’re no stranger to a nose nudging you. Whether it’s a nose in the back, a
            nose on your leg, or even a nose in your face, your dog is just doing what comes naturally. Although this
            breed isn’t often used to herd anymore, that herding heritage remains. So, along with the herding traits of
            independent thinking and intelligence, it’s perfectly normal for your GSD to herd human family members. Your
            dog might also show “following ahead” behavior – walking in front of you while looking back to ensure you’re
            walking in the right direction.
            <li><h3>GSDs are loving companions</h3></li>
            These are very social dogs who want to spend time with their humans. The more time your dog gets to spend
            with you, the happier your companion will be. They may exhibit aloofness with strangers rather than immediately
            adoring everyone they see, but that only makes their love even more special. Plus, these loyal and dedicated
            guardians and gentle family pets are willing to put their life on the line to protect their loved ones.
            And you can’t ask for a more loving best friend than that.
