       <h2>What is climbing?</h2>

        <p>
        Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial
        rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without
        falling.
        </p>

        <h2>How I started climbing</h2>
        <p>
            I first started climbing at a bouldering/ninja warrior training gym in Pennsylvania back in August 2018. I
            found bouldering to be my most favorite hobby. I was never good at sports as a kid, but always had upper body
            strength. Bouldering was perfect for me; I didn't have to disappoint my teammates and could rely solely on
            my strength. I took a year long hiatus when the pandemic hit, and was slow to get back into it. I now have
            a membership at the Minneapolis Bouldering Project. I got my boyfriend, sister, her partner, and many friends
            into climbing as well. I have even found a BIPOC climbing crew to climb with every Wednesday.

    <article><h2>Bouldering Basics</h2>
        <p>
            Bouldering is a simple form of climbing low down without using ropes.
            Indoor boulders are generally around three or four meters tall with padded mats beneath them to absorb your
            fall. There are a few things to be aware of to boulder safely:
        </p>
        <p><h3>Clear Landing Zone</h3>
            Work out where you might fall before you start. Clear away any water bottles, chalk bags and other objects
            that are in your fall zone. Ask anyone who's sitting on the mats to move away.
            While you're climbing, keep an eye out for unobservant climbers or stray children who may wander underneath
            you. Your spotter can help with this too.
        </p>
        <p><h3>Be Aware</h3>
            Climbing walls can get busy. Make sure to stay out of the potential landing zone of other climbers.
            Many routes share space on the wall, so be aware of where your route goes compared to others.
            Keep a reasonable distance between yourself and the next climber, so that you won't swing into each other
            if you fall.
        </p>
        <p><h3>Spotters</h3>
            A spotter is someone who stands beneath a climber and helps them fall correctly. The point of spotting is
            to push the climber so they land on their feet â€“ you are not trying to catch them!
            Hold out your arms and be ready to push them onto the centre of the pad, aiming for their mid back or
            shoulders. Some climbers prefer to tuck their thumbs in to their palms to avoid dislocating them.
            Some boulder problems cause the climber to change the way they lean from holds. This changes the trajectory
            of a potential fall and can be difficult to spot. For problems like this, consider having two or more
            spotters, each with their own spotting zone.
