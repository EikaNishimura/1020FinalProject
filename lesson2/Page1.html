    <article><h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Eika Nishimura. I am 24 years old, born and raised in New Jersey, and now a transplant
            living in Minnesota. I found an interest in technology early on in my life since by dad is a computer
            engineer. I moved in with my oldest sister a couple of years ago who was also a software programmer, but switched
            careers to a UX designer. After seeing my sister pursue her dreams of being in tech, and feeling tired of retail,
            I decided to major in computer science. This is my second course related to computer science.
        </p>

            When I am not in school, I am most likely working at my local grocery store. I work in the meat & seafood
            department and consider myself to be a connoisseur in the field. I have been working there for almost two years now.
        </p>

            I have a passion for bouldering, a type of climbing where no gear is required. I aspire to become a pro climber
            one day. I have a membership at Minneapolis Bouldering Project, which has a large but tight knit community.
            I usually climb up three times a week with my boyfriend. On Wednesdays, I attend a BIPOC climbing crew where we
            bond over our love for climbing.
