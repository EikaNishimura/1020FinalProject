    <article><h2>My interest in plants</h2>
        <p>
            Like most people when the pandemic first hit, I became interested in adopting indoor house plants. I started
            off with a few succulents that were on sale at Lowe's and Home Depot, then ventured off to bigger nurseries
            and greenhouses. I fell in love with monstera and caladium plants which are my favorite. I know own more than 35
            house plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also taken an interest in hydroponics because of the cold and harsh Minnesota winters. I've attempted to
            grow pumpkins, cucumbers, and lettuce.

    <article><h2>Basic plant care</h2>

        <h3>How much light do indoor plants need?</h3>

        <p>
        Succulents and cacti need continuous, daily sunlight. Plants with foliage need roughly 8 hours of light per day.
        The amount of light depends on the plants you are growing, so we suggest doing research on the specific plants
        you are growing.
        </p>

        <h3>What qualities make for a good indoor plant?</h3>

        <p>
            There are several qualities to look for when selecting an indoor plant.
            <ol>
                <li>A good root system – This is incredibly important when choosing a plant. It’s not practical to pull
                    a plant out of its pot to check its roots but if it is a small plant, this can be done. Healthy
                    roots are thick and light in color.</li>
                <li>Foliage- Here’s a good rule of thumb when it comes to plant foliage: if you can’t see through it,
                    the foliage is thick enough.</li>
                <li>Check for disease – Some signs of a plant with pests or disease are: white dots, sticky residue on
                    the leaves and a bad odor.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Which indoor plants require low light?</h3>

        <p>
            Indoor plants that need little light could be good fits for locations where light is more dim. Some plants
            that require low light are:
            <ul>
                <li>Philodendron – A very common indoor plant that rarely attracts pests. It’s a hearty plant that is
                    adaptable to various environments</li>
                <li>Pothos or Devil’s Ivy- A plant with colorful and vibrant leaves. This plant does great in a variety
                    of environments, thriving in low light or in bright, indirect light.</li>
                <li>Dracaena– This is another popular indoor plant with long green leaves. This is one indoor plant you
                    will want to prune if foliage gets too long.</li>
                <li>Peace Lily- This plant thrives best when the soil is moist, but not overwatered. If you want flowers
                    to appear on your peace lily plant, move your plant to a darker room.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>How do you care for indoor plants?</h3>

        <p>
            Here are some tips that will help you care for indoor plants:

            <ul>
                <li>Keep potting soil moist- It’s important to make sure soil is not too wet nor too dry</li>
                <li>Make sure the plant pot has drainage holes in the bottom of the pot</li>
                <li>Place your plant near a light source, whether it’s natural or artificial</li>
                <li>Determine what species of plant you have so you can more accurately care for it</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>What is hydroponics?</h2>

        <p>
            Hydroponics is a way to skip the soil, sub in a different material to support the roots of the plant, and grow
            crops directly in nutrient-rich water. There are multiple approaches to designing hydroponic systems, but the
            core elements are essentially the same.
        </p>

        <h3>What you'll need</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh water. Were talking primo, filtered stuff with a balanced pH. Most plants like water with a
                    pH level around 6–6.5. You can adjust the acidity of your water with over-the-counter solutions
                    found at your local hardware, garden, or hydroponic store.</li>
                <li>Oxygen. Don’t drown your plants! In traditional farming, roots can get the oxygen needed for
                    respiration from pockets of air in the soil. Depending on your hydroponic setup, you will either
                    need to leave space between the base of your plant and the water reservoir, or you’ll need oxygenate
                    your container (think of bubbles in a fish tank), which you can accomplish by buying an air stone or
                    installing an air pump.</li>
                <li>Root Support. Even though you don’t need soil, your plant’s roots still need a little something
                    to hold on to. Typical materials include vermiculite, perlite, peat moss, coconut fiber, and rockwool.
                    Stay away from materials that might compact (like sand) or that don’t retain any moisture
                    (like gravel).</li>
                <li>Nutrients. Your plant is going to need plenty of magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, and other nutrients
                    to stay healthy and productive –– just like plants growing in the ground need healthy soil and
                    fertilizer. When you’re growing plants without soil, this “plant food” must be included in the water
                    that’s feeding your plants. While you can technically make your own nutrient solution, it’s easy to
                    buy mixtures online and in stores.</li>
                <li>
                    Light. If you’re growing your plants indoors, you might have to invest in some special lighting.
                    Each kind of plant will have a different requirement for the amount of light it needs and for the
                    placement of lights (typically referred to as Daily Light Integral or DLI).</li>
            </ul>
