    <article><h2>My passion for cooking</h2>
        <p>
            I've always loved watching cooking shows growing up, but would never dare attempt it myself.
            It wasn't until I was 22 years old that I developed the need to learn. With lots of trial and error,
            I am now a decent home cook specializing in Asian cuisine. My favorite dishes to make are mapo tofu, spicy
            pan fried salmon, and tonkatsu.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this blog, I will share new recipes that I have found and loved.

    <article><h2>Vegan Pumpkin Pie</h2>
        <p> This vegan pumpkin pie recipe is so tasty, you won't be able to tell that it's vegan!</p>
        <p> <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 15oz can of pumpkin puree </li>
                <li> 1 cup coconut cream </li>
                <li> 1 cup brown sugar </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon cinnamon </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ginger </li>
                <li> 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg </li>
                <li> 1/8 teaspoon cloves </li>
                <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li> 3 tablespoons cornstarch </li>
                <li> Pie crust </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> <h3>Instructions</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a pie crust in a pie plate.</li>
                <li> Add the canned pumpkin, coconut cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, salt and
                    cornstarch to a blender and blend until very smooth. You may also simply whisk it together in a bowl
                    until smooth.</li>
                <li> Bake for 1 hour. If the crust starts to burn, cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or a
                    pie shield after about 30 minutes of baking. The middle will still look jiggly; that's normal. Let
                    cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then cover and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for
                    at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>
                    Slice and serve with Vegan Whipped Cream or store bought non-dairy whipped topping, if desired.
                    Enjoy!

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2-1/2 pounds bone-in chicken thighs</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
                <li>10 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>4 celery ribs, chopped</li>
                <li>4 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>3 cups uncooked kluski or other egg noodles (about 8 ounces)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>Optional: Additional salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels; sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a 6-qt. stockpot, heat oil over
                    medium-high heat. Add chicken in batches, skin side down; cook until dark golden brown, 3-4 minutes.
                    Remove chicken from pan; remove and discard skin. Discard drippings, reserving 2 tablespoons.</li>
                <li>Add onion to drippings; cook and stir over medium-high heat until tender, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic;
                    cook 1 minute longer. Add broth, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Bring to a boil. Return
                    chicken to pan. Add celery, carrots, bay leaves and thyme. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until chicken
                    is tender, 25-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a plate. Remove soup from heat. Add noodles; let stand, covered, until noodles
                    are tender, 20-22 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, when chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones; discard bones. Shred meat
                    into bite-sized pieces. Return meat to stockpot. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. If desired, adjust
                    seasoning with additional salt and pepper. Discard bay leaves.</li>
            </ol>
