   <article><h2>Basics of HTML & File Management</h2>
                <h3><time datetime="2021-2-10 11:00">October 2, 2021 11:00am</time></h3>
       <p>I learned in the first lesson how to properly save an HTML file using the file type as hyper text markup language. The major lesson I learned were what tags and elements are. Tags are things that tell a browser when a command is going to begin and end. The opening tag includes a left and right angle bracket. The closing tag will have have a a left angle bracket followed by a forward slash and then the right bracket.

    <article><h2>Anatomy of a Webpage</h2>
                <h3><time datetime="2021-3-10 13:10">October 3, 2021 1:10pm</time></h3>
        <p>I also learned the anatomy of a webpage and have been visiting random websites to view their structure. The header is always going to be at the top of the page. Most will have the name of the webpage, the date, log in information, a search bar and navigation. The content will be underneath the header and above the footer. The footer contains copyright information, sitemap, contact information, related documents, etc.

    <article><h2>Headings and Paragraphs</h2>
                <h3><time datetime="2021-5-10 11:55">October 5, 2021 11:55am</time></h3>
        <p>In this lesson, I learned about the headings hierarchy and separating paragraphs within an article using the "p" tag. The h1 heading will be the biggest heading on the webpage and is typically the name of the website. There can be multiple h2 headings that introduces the topic of an article. The h3 tag will introduce a subtopic within the h2 tag. The headings organize the different topics within the webpage.

    <article><h2>Intro to CSS</h2>
                <h3><time datetime="2021-6-10 16:40">October 6, 2021 4:40pm</time></h3>
        <p>CSS is used to style an HTML webpage. CSS is cascading style sheets. Learning this was exciting because HTML is the structure while CSS is the web design. It is used to change the font and its size, color, spacing, etc. The style sheet is within the head and uses the style tag. Curly brackets define a block of code. A selector is used to choose an element within the html document to style.

    <article><h2>CSS Properties and Whitespace</h2>
                <h3><time datetime="2021-7-10 19:30">October 7, 2021 7:30pm</time></h3>
        <p>In this lesson, I learned about web safe colors/fonts and hexadecimal numbers. Web safe colors and fonts are when most computers are able to display them correctly. What I enjoyed the most was learning about whitespace being controlled by margin and padding. Padding makes the webpage look less scrunched together by adding space between the edge of the text and the container. Margin adds space between one container and another.
