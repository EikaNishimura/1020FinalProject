            <h2>What are succulents?</h2>
            <p>
                Though most of us refer to them by the common term, “desert plants,” the term “succulents” has grown in
                popularity. In horticulture, succulents are known as water storage plants. These plants store water in
                their thick, fleshy leaves. But that may be all that succulents have in common, seeing as how they come
                in a seemingly endless array of shapes, sizes, and colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most often asked questions is: “What is the difference between a succulent and a cactus?”
                Cactus plants have spines, needles, and/or prickles; most succulents don’t. There are, however, some
                exceptions; e.g., the Crown of Thorn. A little know fact is that snake plant, kalanchoe, Christmas cactus,
                and asparagus, to name a few, are considered succulents. In any event, basic care is the same for both.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike most perennials, succulents thrive on a bit of neglect. Over centuries, they’ve adapted to be able
                to exist in harsh, dry climates. But while you may picture succulents only growing in the deserts of
                Arizona or Nevada, potted succulents can survive in just about any house across the country.

            <h2>Succulent Care</h2>
            <p>
                While succulents are known for their resilience and low maintenance, there are still a few rules you’ll
                have to follow if you want them to thrive.
            </p>
            <p><h3>Watering</h3>
                Evening is the best time to water succulents, as this is their resting time. Never mist these plants as it
                will cause spotting and/or rotting. It is always better to revive a plant that has too little water than to
                overwater. Plants with leaves that pucker aren’t getting enough water; the ones with soggy leaves are getting
                too much water.
            </p>
            <p><h3>Sunlight</h3>
                Succulents need bright, direct sunlight (4 to 6 hours a day), but can and will survive in bright indirect
                light from a southern window. Indirect lighting will require a lot less water. When you bring home your new
                plant, slowly increase the amount of light it receives, since these plants were greenhouse-grown, where
                lighting is defused.
            </p>
            <p><h3>Soil</h3>
                The perfect soil for succulents and cacti is Espoma Cactus Mix. Also great for growing these plants is
                Diatomaceous Earth, which can be found in most auto supply stores because it is used to clean up oil spills.

                I first bought this succulent at Lowes for a few dollars in late 2019, before the pandemic. I kept it in
                a bluish-green Bulbasaur pot where it lived for over a year. It had new stems growing from it but unfortunately
                was no longer standing straight up. This happened because I was enabling it; I let it grow in the direction of
                the sun and did not rotate it regularly. I've cut off the new growing stems and repotted them and propagated
                a few of the trimmings. The photo above is a recent picture of the original succulent.
