                <h2>About Ivy</h2>
                <p>
                    Ivy can make a wonderful, bright light houseplant. It can grow long and lush and bring a bit of the
                    outdoors inside. Growing ivy indoors is easy as long as you know what makes an ivy plant happy.
                    Let’s learn a little bit more about ivy and proper ivy plant care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    English ivy cultivars are the most common type of ivy grown in the home, but all can be found if you
                    look hard enough. Each of the varieties of inside ivy plants also come in several different cultivars.
                    This means that there is a dizzying array of ivies that you can choose for your home, depending on
                    your preference for color (all shades of green or variegated with white, yellow, gray, black, and cream),
                    leaf shape, and growth habits.

                <h2>Growing Ivy Indoors</h2>
                    <p>
                        Growing ivy indoors isn’t difficult as long as you provide what the plant needs. The most important
                        part of indoor ivy plant care is light. All true ivies need bright light. Variegated cultivars can
                        take medium light, but be aware that their variegation will become less pronounced in less light.
                        Without enough light, inside ivy plants will become leggy and sickly looking. They will also be more
                        prone to pests.
                    </p>
                <h3>Indoor Care</h3>
                    <p>
                    When watering your ivy, always check the soil before adding water. Ivies prefer to be kept slightly on
                    the dry side, so let the soil dry out some (dry to the touch on top) before you water your ivy plant
                    again. Also, make sure that your plant has excellent drainage, as ivy does not like to be in standing
                    water or overly wet soil.

                    I bought this ivy plant at Bachman's inside of a grocery store. It has grown over a foot long
                    since I first bought it. It is a common ivy. I also own another common ivy that has not kept up
                    very well due to lack of sun exposure. I have propagated several trimmings which are growing slowly.
                    I also have a variegated ivy plant. That one has a thin white lining around the leaves.
