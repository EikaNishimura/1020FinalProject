            <h2>About Fiddle Leaf Figs</h2>
            <p>
                Native to the rainforests of western and central Africa, the Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree (Ficus lyrata) is a
                stunning plant with huge green leaves and an even larger following of houseplant fans. Despite its popularity,
                it's certainly not the easiest houseplant to look after, but its visual impact in a space is unmatched
                when given proper conditions and care.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fiddle Leaf Fig appreciates a warm, humid environment, a fair amount of water and plenty of light.
                Choose a location away from air vents and drafts where the tree will receive plenty of bright ambient
                light. Directly in front of, or close by a southern or western facing window is ideal, and eastern
                exposure can also work as long as the plant is directly in the window and the space feels very bright.
                A few hours of direct sun is also beneficial. If placed in a full-sun location (where the plant will
                receive over 6 hours of direct light daily), a humid environment will keep your Fiddle Leaf looking its
                best. We do not recommend this plant for windows with northern exposure. They will not thrive in low-light
                locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fiddle Leaf Fig Trees are particularly sensitive to environmental changes. They will likely take a little
                time to adjust to their new home. Be sure to follow the care instructions, and don’t panic if yours loses
                a few leaves. If leaf discoloration or leaf loss persists, please reach out and we will help troubleshoot!

            <h2>Care Tips</h2>
            <p>
                Always be sure to assess your plant’s watering needs upon receiving it. Before giving your plant a drink,
                it is best to check the moisture level in the soil first to ensure it isn’t moist right beneath the surface.
                Also, consider aerating the soil of your plant before the initial watering. Many growers compact the soil
                to avoid shifting during transit, so aerating can aid in drainage, help the soil breathe and allow moisture
                to be released.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fiddle Leaf Fig likes its soil to be kept consistently, evenly moist with a brief drying out period
                between waterings as it comes from an area of the world that gets very dry between rain storms. Water it
                thoroughly whenever the top 2” of soil have dried. Allowing the soil to dry deep to the lower root system
                will lead to leaf loss, so be sure to check in with the soil regularly until you develop a routine with
                your plant. In contrast, too much moisture in the soil can lead to root rot and also cause leaves to drop.
            </p>
            <p>
                We highly recommend potting your Fiddle Leaf, as it is a challenging plant to keep alive long term in its
                nursery pot — however make sure to pot it in a permanent planter with plenty of soil mass and crucially,
                drainage. If your Fiddle Leaf Fig is planted in a container without a drainage hole, you must be very careful
                not to overwater. In this scenario we suggest allowing your Fiddle Leaf Fig to dry out slightly more between
                waterings and use a soil probe to see how damp the soil is at the root level before watering. These plants
                do particularly well in our self watering containers!

                I bought this fiddle leaf fig at Home Depot with the pot included for $24.99. It was in rough shape; it had brown
                spots all over and very few leaves. I've followed care tips that I found online, and have since kept it
                underneath a grow light and will occasionally move it to the bathroom when I take a hot shower since
                it naturally grows in a humid environment. It now stands over two feet tall and continues to grow strong
                with a thick trunk. The leaves are bright green and waxy.
