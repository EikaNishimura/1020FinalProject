                    <p>
                        Caladiums are known for their big, heart-shaped leaves that display amazing color combinations
                        of white, pink, red and green. These are plants that thrive in hot, humid weather and that
                        usually grow best in full to partial shade. Though caladiums rarely flower, their beautiful
                        foliage guarantees a colorful show wherever they are planted -- beneath trees, between shrubs,
                        in perennial borders and in containers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wait to plant your caladiums outdoors until two or three weeks after the last frost date.
                        Nights should be warm and the soil temperature should be 65-70°F. In cool climates this will
                        be early to mid-June.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To stimulate bushier growth, some varieties of caladiums can be "de-eyed" before planting.
                        Use a paring knife to carefully cut out one or more of the primary sprouts, taking care not
                        to damage the surrounding tissue or any smaller buds. Though at first this will set the plant
                        back by a couple weeks, many other sprouts will soon begin developing, giving you a shorter,
                        yet fuller plant.

                <h2>My Interest in Plants</h2>
                <p>
                    Like most people when the pandemic first hit, I became interested in adopting indoor house plants. I started
                    off with a few succulents that were on sale at Lowe's and Home Depot, then ventured off to bigger nurseries
                    and greenhouses. I fell in love with monstera and caladium plants which are my favorite. I now own more than 35
                    house plants. Like the quote from Hello Miss Kay:

            <h2>Basic Watering Care for Indoor Plants</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul id="sidebar-list-container">
                        <li>Don’t use hot or cold water or else you might shock the roots</li>
                            <p>Sometimes using ice cubes is recommended for regulating a very light watering routine
                            but don’t put them directly on plant material.</p>
                        <li>Using softened water is okay but distilled water is best because it won’t have the salt or
                            fluoride that will be in your tap water, which can be bad for plants in excess quantities
                            (sensitivity to this is varies per plant)</li>
                            <p>Tap-watered houseplants will slowly accumulate salts on the top layer of media over time
                                - it’s that moldy-looking whiteish yellowish stuff</p>
                        <li>Most plants like to be watered thoroughly until water drips from the bottom of the pot.
                            Discard any excess water sitting in the saucer</li>
                            <p>Misting is usually more about increasing the plant’s relative humidity than hydration</p>
                        <li>
                            Plants that like to be more wet than others: Citrus, Ferns (maiden hair in particular),
                            Ficus Trees, Palms and Spathiphyllum</li>
                            <p>Keep in mind that nothing should be wet all the time except aquatic plant</p>
                        <li>Most plants require water when the top 2" of the soil feels dry to touch</li>
                            <p>Some would like to dry out completely before getting watered again</p>
                    </ul>
